# docker-chromedriver

Docker image for Java automated UI tests.

Since most of the UI testing requires us to host the chrome browser and test it against it, we have created this utility docker which has the Chrome installed and also the ChromeDriver needed for Selenium tests.

Includes:

* JDK 8
* Maven 3.6.0
* Chrome (latest)
* ChromeDriver 74

Available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaibhav14/chrome74).
